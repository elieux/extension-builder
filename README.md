Extension Builder
=================

A tool to create native browser extensions. Currently supports:

- OEX: Opera 11,12
- NEX: Opera 15+
- CRX: Chrome, Chromium
- XPI: Firefox 21+
- user JS: various browsers, perhaps with the help of *Monkey extensions

The tool is working, but the developer uses it only for one project, so it may not suit the needs of your project.

Usage
-----

Create a build.json file in your project directory, point it at your files and then run the build.php script. You should get all the compiled files in the output directory.
